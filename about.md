Hi, my name is Dani ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m currently studying for a Masterâ€™s degree in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science at [Lomonosov Moscow State University](https://www.msu.ru/index.php), [Faculty of Computational Mathematics and Cybernetics](https://cs.msu.ru). Iâ€™m also working as a Deep Learning Engineer at [MTS AI Lab](https://moskva.mts.ru/about/media-centr/soobshheniya-kompanii/novosti-mts-v-rossii-i-mire/2020-03-02/mts-i-skolteh-otkryli-laboratoriyu-iskusstvennogo-intellekta).

In my spare time, I like to learn something new about Deep Learning and implement different models with PyTorch, so this what the blog is about!
For more information, please visit my [GitHub](https://github.com/dayyass) and [pet-projects](https://dayyass.github.io/pet_projects).
