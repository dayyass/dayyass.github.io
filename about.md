Hi, my name is Dani!

Iâ€™m currently studying for a Master's degree in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science at Lomonosov Moscow State University, Faculty of Computational Mathematics and Cybernetics.
I'm also working as a Deep Learning Engineer at MTS AI Lab.

In my spare time, I like to learn something new about Deep Learning and implement different models with PyTorch, so this what the blog is about!
